What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, git creates a .git file
which starts tracking the commits in that repository
This is how we start projects!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area lets you add multiple files that you want to include in a commit. This allows you to make commits based on logical changes that may span multiple files.
