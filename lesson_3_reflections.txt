When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You can use remote repositories when you want to collaborate with others 
or access your information from cloud storage.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The remote repository may have multiple people editing it.
You might be working on something that is independent of the changes pushed by others to the remote
so you want to be able to work on your version without it being
thrown off by other (potentially irrelevant) updates.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is like a clone that happens on GitHub's servers - 
you copy the repository to your profile, but not to your local computer. Use this to make a copy of an existing repository that you want to make your own changes to, or use for collaboration with others.
A clone copies a repository and can be from GitHub to your local computer or just a copy from local to local. You can use this to work on an existing repository or make your own thing.
Branches happen within a repository - you can make experimental features, fix bugs, make alternative versions of something, etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Lets you compare your work to the ongoing work of others, especially if you will be 
offline for a period.
